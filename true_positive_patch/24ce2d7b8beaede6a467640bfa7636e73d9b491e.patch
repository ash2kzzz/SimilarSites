Subject: mmc: tmio: bring tuning HW to a sane state with MMC_POWER_OFF
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

When powering off a card, we need to disable the tuning HW (like SCC for
the Renesas SDHI) to get to a sane state and allow for re-tuning new
cards. This was hidden before because we wrongly did that in hw_reset()
before which was an unintended use of hw_reset(). Now that we corrected
the use of hw_reset() meanwhile, we revealed this shortcoming and need
to fix it properly by explicitly calling the downgrade callback.

Fixes: 6e7d4de10890 ("mmc: renesas_sdhi: move wrong 'hw_reset' to 'reset'")
