Subject: powerpc/book3s64/pkey: Disable pkey on POWER6 and before

POWER6 only supports AMR update via privileged mode (MSR[PR] = 0,
SPRN_AMR=29) The PR=1 (userspace) alias for that SPR (SPRN_AMR=13) was
only supported from POWER7. Since we don't allow userspace modifying
of AMR value we should disable pkey support on P6 and before.

The hypervisor will still report pkey support via
"ibm,processor-storage-keys". Hence also check for P7 CPU_FTR bit to
decide on pkey support.
