Subject: ALSA: hda/ca0132 - Fix possible workqueue stall

The unsolicited event handler for the headphone jack on CA0132 codec
driver tries to reschedule the another delayed work with
cancel_delayed_work_sync().  It's no good idea, unfortunately,
especially after we changed the work queue to the standard global
one; this may lead to a stall because both works are using the same
global queue.

Fix it by dropping the _sync but does call cancel_delayed_work()
instead.
