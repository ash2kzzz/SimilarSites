Subject: KVM: arm/arm64: arch_timer: Fix CNTP_TVAL calculation
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Recently the generic timer test of kvm-unit-tests failed to complete
(stalled) when a physical timer is being used. This issue is caused
by incorrect update of CNTP_CVAL when CNTP_TVAL is being accessed,
introduced by 'Commit 84135d3d18da ("KVM: arm/arm64: consolidate arch
timer trap handlers")'. According to Arm ARM, the read/write behavior
of accesses to the TVAL registers is expected to be:

  * READ: TimerValue = (CompareValue â€“ (Counter - Offset)
  * WRITE: CompareValue = ((Counter - Offset) + Sign(TimerValue)

This patch fixes the TVAL read/write code path according to the
specification.
