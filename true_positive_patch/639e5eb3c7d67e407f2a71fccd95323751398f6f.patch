Subject: ASoC: wm_adsp: Correct handling of compressed streams that restart

Previously support was added to allow streams to be stopped and
started again without the DSP being power cycled and this was done
by clearing the buffer state in trigger start. Another supported
use-case is using the DSP for a trigger event then opening the
compressed stream later to receive the audio, unfortunately clearing
the buffer state in trigger start destroys the data received
from such a trigger. Correct this issue by moving the call to
wm_adsp_buffer_clear to be in trigger stop instead.

Fixes: 61fc060c40e6 ("ASoC: wm_adsp: Support streams which can start/stop with DSP active")
