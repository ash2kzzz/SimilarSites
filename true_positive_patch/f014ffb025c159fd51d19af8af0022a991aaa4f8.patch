Subject: afs: Fix afs_server struct leak

Fix a leak of afs_server structs.  The routine that installs them in the
various lookup lists and trees gets a ref on leaving the function, whether
it added the server or a server already exists.  It shouldn't increment
the refcount if it added the server.

The effect of this that "rmmod kafs" will hang waiting for the leaked
server to become unused.

Fixes: d2ddc776a458 ("afs: Overhaul volume and server record caching and fileserver rotation")
