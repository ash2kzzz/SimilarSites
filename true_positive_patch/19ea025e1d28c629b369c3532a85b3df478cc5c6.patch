Subject: nvme: Add quirk for Kingston NVME SSD running FW E8FK11.T

Kingston NVME SSD with firmware version E8FK11.T has no interrupt after
resume with actions related to suspend to idle. This patch applied
NVME_QUIRK_SIMPLE_SUSPEND quirk to fix this issue.

Fixes: d916b1be94b6 ("nvme-pci: use host managed power state for suspend")
