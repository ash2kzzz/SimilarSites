Subject: arm64: dts: meson-gx: Fix the SCPI DVFS node name and unit address

Node names should be generic and use hyphens instead of underscores to
not cause warnings. Also nodes without a reg property should not have a
unit-address. Change the scpi_dvfs node to use clock-controller as node
name without a unit address (since it does not have a reg property).

Fixes: 70db166a2baa ("ARM64: dts: meson-gxbb: Add SCPI with cpufreq & sensors Nodes")
