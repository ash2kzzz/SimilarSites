Subject: ARM: dts: imx7d-smegw01: Fix USB host over-current polarity

Currently, when resetting the USB modem via AT commands, the modem is
no longer re-connected.

This problem is caused by the incorrect description of the USB_OTG2_OC
pad. It should have pull-up enabled, hysteresis enabled and the
property 'over-current-active-low' should be passed.

With this change, the USB modem can be successfully re-connected
after a reset.
