Subject: arm64: dts: sdm845: Rename qspi data12 as data23

There are 4 qspi data pins: data0, data1, data2, and data3. Currently
we have a shared pin state for data0 and data1 (2 lane config) and a
pin state for data2 and data3 (you'd enable both this and the 2 lane
state for 4 lanes). The second state is obviously misnamed. Fix it.
