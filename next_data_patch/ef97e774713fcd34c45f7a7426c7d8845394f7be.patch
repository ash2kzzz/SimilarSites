Subject: KEYS: Add missing function documentation

Compiling with 'W=1' results in warnings that 'Function parameter or member
not described'

Add the missing parameters for
restrict_link_by_builtin_and_secondary_trusted and
restrict_link_to_builtin_trusted.

Use /* instead of /** for get_builtin_and_secondary_restriction, since
it is a static function.

Fix wrong function name restrict_link_to_builtin_trusted.

Fixes: d3bfe84129f6 ("certs: Add a secondary system keyring that can be added to dynamically")
