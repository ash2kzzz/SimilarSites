Subject: mm: fix memory leak on mm_init error handling

commit f1a7941243c1 ("mm: convert mm's rss stats into percpu_counter")
introduces a memory leak by missing a call to destroy_context() when a
percpu_counter fails to allocate.

Before introducing the per-cpu counter allocations, init_new_context() was
the last call that could fail in mm_init(), and thus there was no need to
ever invoke destroy_context() in the error paths.  Adding the following
percpu counter allocations adds error paths after init_new_context(),
which means its associated destroy_context() needs to be called when
percpu counters fail to allocate.
