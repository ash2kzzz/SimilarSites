Subject: include/linux/mm: fix release_pages_arg kernel doc comment

Commit 449c796768c9 ("mm: teach release_pages() to take an array of
encoded page pointers too") added the kernel doc comment for
release_pages() on top of 'union release_pages_arg', so making 'make
htmldocs' complains as below:

    ./include/linux/mm.h:1268: warning: cannot understand function prototype: 'typedef union '

The kernel doc comment for the function is already on top of the
function's definition in mm/swap.c, and the new comment is actually not
for the function but indeed release_pages_arg.  Fixing the comment to
reflect the intent would be one option.  But, kernel doc cannot parse
the union as below due to the attribute.

    ./include/linux/mm.h:1272: error: Cannot parse struct or union!

Modify the comment to reflect the intent but do not mark it as a kernel
doc comment.
