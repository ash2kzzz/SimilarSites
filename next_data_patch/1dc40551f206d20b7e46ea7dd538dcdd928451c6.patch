Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: ipq8074-hk10: enable QMP device, not the PHY node

Correct PCIe PHY enablement to refer the QMP device nodes rather than
PHY device nodes. QMP nodes have 'status = "disabled"' property in the
ipq8074.dtsi, while PHY nodes do not correspond to the actual device and
do not have the status property.
