Subject: ASoC: codecs: wsa883x: do not set can_multi_write flag

regmap-sdw does not support multi register writes, so there is
no point in setting this flag. This also leads to incorrect
programming of WSA codecs with regmap_multi_reg_write() call.

This invalid configuration should have been rejected by regmap-sdw.
