Subject: checkpatch: don't print the next line if not defined
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

When checking if "Reported-by" tag is followed by "Link:", there is no
need to print the next line if there is no next line.

While at it, also mention in this case that the "Link:" tag should be
followed by a URL, similar to the next warning.

By doing that, the code is now similar to what is done above when checking
if the Co-developed-by tag is properly used.
