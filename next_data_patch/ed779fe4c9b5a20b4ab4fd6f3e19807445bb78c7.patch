Subject: neighbour: fix unaligned access to pneigh_entry

After the blamed commit, the member key is longer 4-byte aligned. On
platforms that do not support unaligned access, e.g., MIPS32R2 with
unaligned_action set to 1, this will trigger a crash when accessing
an IPv6 pneigh_entry, as the key is cast to an in6_addr pointer.

Change the type of the key to u32 to make it aligned.

Fixes: 62dd93181aaa ("[IPV6] NDISC: Set per-entry is_router flag in Proxy NA.")
