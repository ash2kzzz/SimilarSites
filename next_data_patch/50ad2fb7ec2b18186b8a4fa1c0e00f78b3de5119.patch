Subject: selftests/resctrl: Fix incorrect error return on test complete
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

An error snuck in between two recent conflicting changes:
Until recently ->setup() used negative values to indicate
normal test termination. This was changed in
commit fa10366cc6f4 ("selftests/resctrl: Allow ->setup() to return
errors") that transitioned ->setup() to use negative values
to indicate errors and a new END_OF_TESTS to indicate normal
termination.

commit 42e3b093eb7c ("selftests/resctrl: Fix set up schemata with 100%
allocation on first run in MBM test") continued to use
negative return to indicate normal test termination.

Fix mbm_setup() to use the new END_OF_TESTS to indicate
error-free test termination.

Fixes: 42e3b093eb7c ("selftests/resctrl: Fix set up schemata with 100% allocation on first run in MBM test")
